<h1> <i><b>radhakrishna</b></i></h1>
<p>Radha-Krishna (IAST rādhā-kṛṣṇa, Sanskrit: राधा कृष्ण) is the combined form of the Hindu god Krishna with his chief consort and shakti Radha. They are regarded as the feminine as well as the masculine realities of God,[7] in several Krishnaite traditions of Vaishnavism.[8][9][10]

In the Krishnaite traditions of Vaishnavism, Krishna is referred to as Svayam Bhagavan [11] and Radha is illustrated as the primeval potency of the three main potencies of God, Hladini (immense spiritual bliss), Sandhini (eternality), and Samvit (existential consciousness), of which Radha is an embodiment of the feeling of love towards Krishna (Hladini).[12][13]</p>
